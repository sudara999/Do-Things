#### 2. Your tentative target user population

Generally, people of an older generation who are yet uncomfortable with web browsing. (Aged 50 and above)

#### 3. The problem your product will be solving. Explain how your solution will be unique or different than existing solutions.

People who have not spent a lot of time on the internet are often uncomfortable using it. The variety of services and ways to navigate the internet only add additional challenges. Oftentimes this leads to them resorting to other less optimal options that, nevertheless, they may find more familiar, such as having to call family members or stores for information that may be easily accessible online. This is especially a problem when dealing with news and other information that may change on a regular basis.
Our solution is to aggregate such sources of frequently updated information into a simple app that integrates text to speech to make it more accessible. As users in such conditions may not have consistent internet access, we will also deliver the information as a downloadable package on a regular basis.

#### 4. Two or three existing or related solutions that your target users may use already to try and solve this problem. Provide a brief description of these solutions and link to them (if applicable). These can be brief descriptions now, as you will do a deeper analysis in a future assignment.

+ Newspapers - Newspapers provide up-to-date information about the world around us in a formal, detailed manner. People also typically associate newspapers with accuracy and neutrality.

+ Television- TV channels have always been the main source of information and entertainment for a lot of the older generation when younger ones shifted to online platforms and applications. The same with news, in this era, when it is available at any time on the internet; the older generation still relies on specific schedules for news or other media.

+ Mobile Communication - For any inquiries upon any breaking news or status, for example, the CoronaVirus, elder people simply make a call to their family members or any other source to get an update on the situation. 

+ Radio - The radio is an easy way to get information such as news, music and other forms of entertainment in a purely audio format. This may facilitate multi tasking as the user may do something else like driving while listening to the radio.

#### 5. Your plan to find people in your target population to observe, survey, or interview them. (e.g. could be via a specific online forum, in-person at certain locations, attending a meetup, etc.). Describe the process you think you will use to find these people, as you will need to interview at least 3 target users for the next assignment (via phone, online, or in person).

Unfamiliarity is something that weâ€™ve encountered frequently in the older generation, especially with our parents. We could directly talk to our parents and ask them about their experience adapting to the new and rapidly changing internet ecosystem as well as their thoughts regarding these changes. We can also draw from our own observations of how they have commented on and interacted with the internet in the past.
We could also speak to older people who are more familiar with technology, such as professors, to get their perspective on the changes and how they have come to deal with them in fields that require them to adapt to the internet. We could also ask them about the existing solutions that they use and determine the strengths and weaknesses of those solutions.
