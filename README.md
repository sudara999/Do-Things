#### The problem your product will be solving. Explain how your solution will be unique or different than existing solutions.

The broader goal of our application is to allow greater accessibility for people who are unfamiliar with the use of technology. To that end, the specific workflow that we wanted to enable was to allow people (subsequently referred to as helpers) to remotely help someone else with tasks on their phone (remote viewing, remote control, and voice communications) and for the person receiving that help (subsequently referred to as helpees) to be able to record the actions being taken and be able to replay that action whenever they might need it. We wanted something that was universal, not limited to certain apps or services, and that had the flexibility to work across applications. And we felt that in general it was a lot more productive to provide this service instead of aiming to aggregate or teach users through traditional methods.
Our research showed that for the vast majority of people, the most convenient and comfortable way to provide help was through some form of direct supervision, however one consistent weakness of direct supervision is both issues with how inconvenient it often is to be able to have this kind of direct supervision, as well as the fact that people receiving help often need help doing the same task multiple times, which adds to the overhead.
In order to solve this, we wanted to provide remote access so that the people requiring help can reach the helpee at their convenience and the helper can provide the kind of help that has been consistently been found to be the most effective in our surveys (direct supervision).
